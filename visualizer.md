Included with [genome_highlighter](https://github.com/nowling-lab/enhancer-dissection) is a dashboard made with [dash](https://plotly.com/).

This dashboard allows for the easy sorting, filtering and viewing of the data generated by [genome_highlighter](https://github.com/nowling-lab/enhancer-dissection) when the --csv flag is used. 

The currently supported functionality allows for a variety of filtering:
	$  ge or >=
	$  le or <=
	$  lt or <
	$  gt or >
	$  ne or !=
	$  eq or =
	$ - (between, inclusive on both ends)

for numeric columns. Additionally, for string columns, simply typing in them will allow for filtering based on if the string is in any of the columns entries. There as an optional ignore case button included as well. 

Some examples of this type of filtering are like so:

The datatable also supports sorting by ascending or descending:

Lastly there are histograms provided to allow for easily selecting outliers and viewing the distributions of various columns. Clicking on any of these columns will filter the table by that column:

Because bucket size sometimes is very narrow, clicking and dragging will zoom in the table to allow ease of access:

Double click on the chart to reset the zoom of the chart.

However, note that if using the historgram to filter, normal filtering will become unavailable Trying to filter any column will undo the filtering supplied by the histogram, and will apply to the entire table. Sorting is still available though:
